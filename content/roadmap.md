#### The Roadmap

Building a distribution is arguably a trivial thing to do. Doing it __right__, however, is much
more difficult. As we've detailed elsewhere, we're taking things slowly to allow the planning
discussions to happen.

Detailed below is the progress roadmap to a self-hosting binary distribution. Note our goal is
to support a mixed source/binary distribution, but that requires being able to self build with
__consistency__ and __reproducability__, through every step.
