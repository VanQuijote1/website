Please note this page has been written without legal consultation, and
sets out the policies we intend to operate by. If you find issues with
this policy, or have any questions in general with the policy, please
contact the [Data Protection Officer](mailto:ikey@serpentos.com).

Additionally this policy may be updated at any time, without notice, as
we do not retain information for bulk-email purposes.

Our core policy, in laymans terms, is:

    We don't want or need your data.


### Services

Our services are defined as our primary website, our [Tracker](https://dev.serpentos.com)
and our downloads (packages + OS Image Files).

By using Serpent OS, or our services, you agree to all terms of our Privacy Policy.

### Data Retention

Our services and server network do not deliberately collect any identifying information.
We only provide online services over HTTPS (SSL) and at most the servers create automatic
access logs with the IP address and timestamp.

These logs are only used in short-term analysis to detect any malicious activity from
bad actors and potential security breaches. No personally identifying information is
attached to the log files and they are automatically purged within a 4-week window.

### Requesting Data

The following details are required for Phabricator interaction to work collectly:

 - A valid email address to prevent spambot registration. This allows notifications
   to be sent out via email, and the user may disable such notications.
 - An account username (can be any valid username) for logging in
 - A so-called "real-name field" which may be a psuedonym.

Upon request from the *associated email address* for verification and security purposes,
we will provide a full dump of the user profile information we have in Phabricator within
4 weeks should the user request it and has a valid account.

Note, it is often easier to visit your Profile page within Phabricator which will yield
the same, editable information.

No other service within our control has any record of users or personally identifiable
information.

### Content Vs Personally Identifiable Data

We identify content as willing provided and becoming a central part of the platform.
It is at the user's discretion if they provide their real name or not (except in the
case of code contributions). By submitting content, you agree that it will remain
part of the target platform (i.e. Phabricator) as long as it is consistent with
community guidelines (in which case we may remove offensive content.)

### Code Contributons

We require **code contributions** to be made under an identifiable name, for the purposes
of security audits and git history. Additionally, submitting code is understood to be
within compliance with the software license of the project in question, and is outside
the purview of the GDPR.

When submitted, code contributions form a static part of the git history of a given
project and cannot be removed. They can only be removed from the **used** code and
git tree, and will not be removed unless there is a valid, software-engineering reason
to do so (i.e. compliance, usefulness).

### Data Deletion

We cannot delete **content** in many cases, and will not attempt to do so,
unless it is not in compliance with community guidelines (i.e. offensive content).
Instead we can delete associated data, by ghosting an account. This is
applicable only to our content platforms, as our other services have no
access to any kind of personally identifable information.

For user account deletion, it is not feasible to achieve this with Phabricator,
as it becomes a core part of the state and working tree. Instead, we can
'ghost' an account, by removing any personally identifying information such
as the account username or 'real name' field, and deactivating the account
against further login attempts.

We cannot, and will not, modify any content containing personally identifying
information that the user has submitted, as it would invalidate the history
of discussions and software development.

### External Content

At times, we may link to or include third-party content on our website. These include, but are not
limited to:

 - [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full)
 - [Tenor](https://tenor.com/legal-terms)
 - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/en/privacy)
 - [YouTube](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)

The above links will take you to the terms of service and/or privacy policy for those websites.
As such, those particular services **may** set cookies on your machine, or process data separately
from Serpent OS. As such you should refer to their terms for how your data is processed.


### Summary

Users of Serpent OS are assured that no personal information is collected on them,
that their privacy is respected, and there is no way for us or a bad actor
to abuse that information.

A Serpent OS system can be updated with no risk of data mining or behavioural
analysis, and users may anonymously converse with the community.
